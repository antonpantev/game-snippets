# Screen Transition Bars
This [Unity Package](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antonpantev/screenshot-saturday/master/UnityPackages/ScreenTransitionBars.unitypackage) has a UI element which creates a screen transition with bars like the one from Pokemon Quest. Try rotating the UI element and giving the bars different start and end colors.

The `ScreenTransitionBars` component has hide and show methods that you call to control the animation:

```
screenTransition.Hide();
screenTransition.Show();
```
